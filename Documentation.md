## What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is an application layer server-side technology which is developed by Facebook for executing queries with existing data. GraphQL can optimize RESTful API calls. It gives a declarative way of fetching and updating your data. GraphQL helps you to load data from server to client. It enables programmers to choose the types of requests they like to make.

In this GraphQL tutorial for beginners, you will learn GraphQL basics:


## Why use GraphQL?

Following are the reasons of using GraphQL:

* It provides a human-readable query.
* In GraphQL, it is very easy to deal with many database.
* It is suited for microservices and complex systems.
* You can fetch data with a single API call.
* It helps you with query batching and caching.
* You do not face, over, and under fetching problems.
* Tailoring requests to your needs.
* It helps you to discover the schema in the appropriate format.
* GraphQL automatically keeps documentation in sync with API changes.
* API evolution is possible without versioning.
* GraphQL fields are used in multiple queries that can be shared to a higher component level for reuse.
* You can choose which functions to expose and how they work.
* It can be used for rapid application prototyping.


## Applications of GraphQL

Here are the important applications of GraphQL:

* It provides Relay and other client frameworks
* GraphQL helps you to improve the performance of the mobile app.
* It can reduce over fetching problem to lower server-side cloud service and decrease the client-side, network usage.
* It can be used when the client application has to specify which fields are needed in long query format.
* GraphQL can be fully utilized when you have to add functionality to your old or existing API.
* It is used when you have to simplify complex API.
* Mix and mash fa√ßade pattern, which is commonly used in object-oriented programming.
* When you have to aggregate data from more than one place into one convenient API.
* You can use GraphQL as an abstraction on an existing API to specify response structure based on user needs.


## What do you need to learn before learning GraphQl?

This GraphQL tutorial is based on [Express](https://www.guru99.com/node-js-express.html) and [NodeJs](https://www.guru99.com/node-js-tutorial.html). Therefore, you can learn GraphQL very easily with a basic understanding of NodeJS.
